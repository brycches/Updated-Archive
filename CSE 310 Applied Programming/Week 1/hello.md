# CSE 310 - Hello World Module Report

Name: Bryce Chesley

## Part 1 - Module Planning

On the first Monday of each Sprint, you will complete the planning section of the Module Report.  Topics include module selection and planning.  For the Hello World program, you will not fill in this section.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. For the Hello World program, you will record your time from Week 1 here.

### Section 2.1 Time Log

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module (Hello World this week) or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.  For the Hello World program, you will complete this at the end of Week 1.

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/B61U8g7i3_g

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No".  If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|

|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    Y   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   | N/A    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    Y   | 
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    Y   |

4. In each Sprint, you will have the opportunity to complete an optional Stretch Challenge for bonus points.  You will normally report what you did here.  There is no Stretch Challenge for Hello World.

5. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       30          |


6. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
well one of my strategies is to sit down and do all my homework at once, getting up as infrequently as possible until it is all done. This works pretty well for lighter loads, but perhaps i should start working throughout the week such that I dont spend an entire day only doing homework.
