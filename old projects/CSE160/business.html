    <h1>My company</h1>
    <h2>Cook it yourself stir fry</h2>
    <p>My company idea is a stir fry based restarount where you build your food yourself. there will be a variety of stir fry options, from various asian options to some that are more italian in nature, and you are able to mix and match them as much as you would like. it will have a variety of fresh ingrediants, and will be priced by weight.</p>
    <p>After choosing your ingredients and weighing them, our staff will start up the stir fry for you, and offer to teach you how to cook a stir fry yourself. if you say yes, you are then taught by our experienced staff how to cook the stir fry, and if you feel comfortable with it you will be invited to cook it yourself. With our excelent staff making sure you stay as safe as possible, and your food is cooked properly, your are sure to both be rewarded with an excelent meal, and the knowledge of how to make it yourself for next time!</p>
